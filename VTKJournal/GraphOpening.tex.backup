This document presents an implementation of an algorithm to perform a morphological opening on a graph. The intent is to remove short branches in a graph while preserving the large scale structure.

This implementation is based on the algorithm described in \cite{Sappa}. We have used the data structures from Boost Graph Library (BGL).

The code is available here:

\section{Introduction}
This document presents an implementation of an algorithm to perform a morphological opening on a graph. This opening consists of a series of erosions, followed by a series of dilations. This is often done as a first step in contour closure algorithms.

This implementation is based on the algorithm described in \cite{Sappa}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Graph Erosion}
Remove all edges attached to EndPoints (leaf nodes). After multiple iterations of this, small branches
will be "absorbed" into a main branch.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Graph Dilation}
Add back edges to current EndPoints. This is NOT simply going to grow back the same tree. If we ran the erosion enough times
to absorb a branch, the branch will not grow back. If we did not, then the branch will indeed grow back.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Algorithm}
\label{sec:Algorithm}
The algorithm proceeds as follow:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Erode the graph until a stopping criteria is met
 \item Dilate the graph the same number of times as the graph was eroded
\end{itemize}

If an edge was removed in the erosion process, as long as it belonged to the child-most branch that was entirely removed, it will not be regrown in the dilation process.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Speedups}
A list of the remaining vertices after every edge removal is created. These are the only vertices which must be determined to be end points or not at the next iteration.

\label{fig:EdgeImage}
\end{figure}

In other cases, we will have a point cloud describing the entire object, not just its boundary. In that case, we must perform a preprocessing step (Section \ref{sec:BoundaryPointDetection}) to determine the boundary points before proceeding with the polygonal outline approximation. In Figure \ref{fig:SolidPointCloud} we show a synthetic example of such a data set.

\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Optional Preprocessing - Boundary point detection}
\label{sec:BoundaryPointDetection}
If our data set is an object described by a solid 2D point cloud, we must first determine which points are on the boundary of the point cloud. Each point is determined to be on the bounary or not based only on its local neighborhood.  We utilize the fact that boundary points, by definition, do not have any neighbors in a large angular section of their neighborhood. Each point is classified using the following procedure:

\begin{itemize}
 \item For each point $p$, find its neighbors $n_i$ within a radius $R$. We use a KD-Tree to efficiently perform the neighborhood search computation.
 \item Determine the angle formed by the vector between $p$ and each $n_i$. These angles are found using the arctangent (i.e. $\theta_i = atan2(n_{i_x} - p_x, n_{i_y} - p_y)$ ), so they are s measured from the standard mathematical reference vector $(1,0)$. 
 \item Sort the vectors by their angles, as the neighbors were not found in any particular anglular order.
 \item Compute the angle between each adjacent ordered vector. This is simply the difference of the angles formed by two adjacent vectors. Be sure to use the interior angle - that is, if the angle difference computed is greater than 180 degrees, subtract the difference from 360. For example, if the two angles are 350 and 10, the difference should be 20.
 \item If the difference between any two adjacent vectors is greater than a threshold (we typically use 70 degrees as the threshold), the point is declared to be a boundary point. 
\end{itemize}

In Figure \ref{fig:BoundaryDetermination}, we show a point which should be classified as a boundary point.

\section{Boundary Polygonal Approximation}
\label{sec:PolygonalApproximation}
The input to this part of the algorithm is a set of points describing the outline of the object. These points will typically be very noisy, either from the acquisition process itself, noise in the acquisition, or error in the boundary point computation or edge detection and thresholding, depending on the type of input data.

\subsection{Rough Boundary Approximation}
We must first form a rough closed loop on the data points. It is acceptable if some points are not included, and it is also acceptable if the boundary contour is self intersecting, but it is critical that the path along the boundary is a closed loop. To find such a contour, we use the following procedure:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Select any point (at random) from which to start.
 \item Find the nearest neighbor to the current point from the set of points that has not already been added to the path and add it to the path. We use a KDTree for computational efficiency.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:RoughBoundary} shows a case where this method works very well. You can see how the noise is followed exactly. This boundary consists of 41 line segments, where one could imagine the rectangular object being represented with only 4.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\subfigure[The boundary points of a rectangular object.]
  {
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{images/rectangleRoughPoints}
  \label{fig:RoughBoundary:Points}
  }
\subfigure[The rough path found on the boundary points.]
  {
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{images/rectangleRoughPath}
  \label{fig:RoughBoundary:Path}
  }
\caption{The rough path computed for a rectangular objects bounding points.}
\label{fig:RoughBoundary}
\end{figure}

As demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:RoughBoundary}, for very low noise, sufficiently dense input data, this procedure works very well. However, in data sets with noise or too few samples in some regions, points may be skipped, which is acceptible. However, often the loop will not be closed before one of these skipped points is the closest non-added point, and a failure case occurs.


\subsection{Boundary Simplification}
Once we have a reasonable closed loop around the points, it is often very noisy. It is often desirable to reduce the data to a simple model. For example, in the case of building detection, we often want to represent a building as a rectangle (4 line segments). Depending on the density of the input, the boundary at this point could be represented by hundreds of line segments, mostly describing the noise. To reduce the number of line segments in the boundary, we use the following procedure:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Create a directed graph of the contour using exactly the vertices of the rough boundary as the vertices and the ordered line segments of the rough boundary as directed edges.
 \item Attempt to add every other possible edge (from each vertex to every other vertex ahead of it in the contour ordering) only if the new edge passes a straightness test.
 \item The straightness test is described in \cite{WangThesis} as the sum of the distances from every point between the two end points to the proposed edge. We have found it more convenient to set this threshold based on the average of these distances, as the length of the edges then is not a factor in determining the straightness criteria.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{images/straightness}
  \caption{The straightness computation of a proposed edge between vertices A and B. Black: the rough boundary. Red: the proposed edge. Blue: the distances from all points on the boundary between A and B to the proposed edge.}
  \label{fig:Straightness}
\end{figure}
 \item By finding any full loop shortest path on this graph, we will have significantly improved (i.e. reduced the line count of) our boundary. However, it is not a well posed graph theoretic problem to ask for the shortest path from a vertex to itself (a loop) and expect a non-zero answer (i.e. the shortest path from a vertex to itself is to not move at all!). To remedy this, we add the ordered vertices around the boundary twice, as well as duplicate the edges on this second loop of vertices. Now we can ask for the shortest path from vertex $i$ to vertex $i+N$ where $N$ is the original number of vertices in the rough boundary.
 \item If we compute this shortest path from any random vertex, we will have a solution to our original problem of finding a low-line segment count approximation to the boundary. However, the choice of starting vertex actually can change the solution, though often only slightly. Because of this, we find the shortest path starting at all vertices, and choose the shorest one as our solution.
\end{itemize}

[Demonstrate the case where the starting point is not on the best shortest path. This is why we must find all shortest paths from all points, not just one.]
